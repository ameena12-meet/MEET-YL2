(A) :- 
*I typed : cd Desktop
cd MEET-YL2
cd Lab1 
cd y2-yearlong-django-review
cd toplists

*then ..
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver

*and to run the website I wrote : http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies

(B) :- *It's http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/1/
* It's http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/2/
* It would be http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/100/

(C) :- * addmovie
* movie_list
* page not found

I wrote it , because I want to add a comment not a movie title, and to call the addcomment function instead :)
