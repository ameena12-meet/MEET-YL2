Great job in taking the challenge of learning something new and going forward with it. Thank you for also using Github to upload your code. I added your demo video to your Github repository as well, just so you have everything there. Your code looks clean and correct. I wanted to see you push yourself a little bit further to try to choose a project that involved checking either how many times or how long the button was pressed and then doing something in relation to that. But Iâ€™m glad you were able to recognize that you could not necessarily finish the project as you originally intended and tried for a slightly easier project that you could finish for sure. I think you had the opportunity to challenge yourself and you took it by teaching yourself how to use Arduinos. You should be proud of your progress and you can definitely share that video to show what you did at MEET.
